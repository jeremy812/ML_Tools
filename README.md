# ML_Tools

## ML Project Structure

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.

2. Get the data.

3. Explore the data to gain insights.

4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.

5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.

6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.

7. Present your solution.

8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

## Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture

1. Define the objective in business terms.

2. How will your solution be used?

3. What are the current solutions/workarounds?

4. How should you frame this problem? Supervised? Online?

5. How should performance be measured?

6. Aligned performance metrics with business goals. 

7. Set minimum performance acceptance. 

8. Investigate existing tools to harvest from.

9. Is human expertise available?

10. How would you solve this manually?

11. List the assumptions made so far. 

12. Verify assumptions.

## Get the Data

Automate these steps where possible.

1. List the data you need and how much you need.

2. Find and document where you can get that data.

3. Check ouw much space it will take.

4. Check legal obligations.

5. Get access authorization.

6. Create a workspace.

7. Get the data.

8. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate without changing the data.

9. Ensure private information is deleted or protected.

10. Check the size and type of data.

11. Sample a test set and put it aside.
